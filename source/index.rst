Creol is a trustless network for enabling the monitoring, energy reduction and carbon offset of the built environment. 

The entire network comprises of a few key constituent parts which are all documented here on their function and their behavior. They are as follows:

* `Creol DLT (Blockchain Components) <https://creol.readthedocs.io>`_ (Work in Progress)
* `Creol dApp (Mobile app for interacting with the DLT Components) <https://creol.readthedocs.io>`_ (Work in Progress)
* `Creol Hardware <https://creol.readthedocs.io>`_ (Work in Progress)
* `Creol BIM <https://creol.readthedocs.io>`_ (Work in Progress)

While each section does its best to breakdown the concepts used within it would be important to familiarize yourself with specific key concepts such as:

* DALI
* Solidity (Ethereum Programming Language)
* Smart Contracts
* dApps
* BIM
* Carbon Offsets
* GHG Accounting/Measurement
