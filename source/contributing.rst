How to Report Issues
====================

To report an issue, please use the
`GitHub issues tracker <https://github.com/creol-network/issues>`_. When
reporting issues, please mention the following details:

* Which version of Creol and what component (DLT,dApp, Hardware) you are using
* What was the source code (if applicable)
* Which platform are you running on
* How to reproduce the issue
* What was the result of the issue
* What the expected behaviour is

Reducing the source code that caused the issue to a bare minimum is always
very helpful and sometimes even clarifies a misunderstanding.
