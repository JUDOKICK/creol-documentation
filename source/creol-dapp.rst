Creol dApp
##########

The Creol dApp is an iOS/Android app built with React-Native to enable user interaction with the smart contracts from the ``creol-eth`` and ``creol-carbon-eth``. It is currently unstable and highly experimental but a release candidate is on the way. 
It allows for users to interact with the spaces that their lights occupy by interacting with ``RoomState`` and ``LEDState`` contracts.

A BIM/Forge model explorer is being worked on seperately in conjunction with the Creol-Bim module. 

The dApp currently supports an Overview page, Controls, and a Carbon Page. Each one showing metrics or current states of the smart contracts represented.
